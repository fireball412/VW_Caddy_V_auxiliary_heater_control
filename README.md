Background: This project is about the automation of the auxiliary heater of a Volkswagen Caddy V (2024) for the purpose of sleeping in the car. 
Issue: The car only allows programming of one heating  activation during night which may yield in too low temperatures.
Solution approach: Measurement of the temperature by temperature by a temperature sensor (DS18B20) and activating the remote control of the auxiliary heater by a servo
The code is written in Arduino for ESP32S3. The temperature sensor is connected to pin 4 and supplied by the 3.3V generated by the LDO of the ESP Development board. The servo is connected to pin 5 and supplied by input voltage of the LDO which is either provided by the USB during debugging or externally via 5Vin. I used 4 cells of NiMh (Eneloop). The average current consumption is around 70mA.
The 3D printed parts are provided in a project. The parts are made for the remote control of a Caddy V (2024) and a standard servo (HK15138). The servo positions must be determined iteratively. The simple program “servo_set” can be useful for this purpose.
The main code measures the temperature and compares with TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW_C. If the temperature is too low it activates the servo for SERVO_HOLD_DURATION_MS. The auxiliary heater runs for 20 minutes. Depending on the temperature the car may cool down fast. Too avoid exceeding the battery of the car (that supplies the auxiliary heater) the heater is not activated before SERVO_COOLDOWN_MS passed by. Activation more often than every 2h is not recommended. 
The LED of the development board indicates the status. Blue/red means temperature is below/above TEMP_THRESHOLD_LOW_C. Yellow means that the temperature measurements results an error
